Hi, my name is Ramiro Berrelleza, welcome!

I'm curently the architect for Hipchat Data Center, out of Atlassian’s lovely San Francisco office. For almost a decade (wow, time flies when you’re having fun!) I’ve been building software that empowers developers to build castles out of thin air. I’m really interested in cloud computing, devices, internet of things, open web and on the team dynamics of software development.

This blog, content and opinions are my own.
