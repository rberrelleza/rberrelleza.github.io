Hi there :wave: !

My name is Ramiro Berrelleza. I'm the founder and CEO of [Okteto](https://okteto.com), where we're busy re-imagining the developer experience for cloud native applications. For over a decade (wow, time flies when you’re having fun!) I’ve been building software that empowers developers to build castles out of thin air. Before Okteto, I built enterprise chat products at Atlassian, application lifecycle management tools at Elasticbox (now part of Centurylink) and cloud services at Microsoft Azure.

 I’m really interested in cloud computing, devices, internet of things, open web, developer tools, the team dynamics of software development and inclusiveness in tech.

This blog, content, and opinions are my own. The blog is hosted on github-pages, and it uses the [haackbar](https://github.com/Haacked/haackbar) template.
